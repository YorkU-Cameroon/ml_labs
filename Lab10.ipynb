        "GPT-2 is a neural-network-powered language model. A language model is a model that predicts the likelihood of a sentence existing in the world. For example, a language model can label the sentence “I take my dog for a walk” as more probable to exist (i.e., on the Internet) than the sentence “I take my banana for a walk.” This is true for sentences as well as phrases and, more generally, any sequence of characters.\r\n",

        "Like most language models, GPT-2 is elegantly trained on an unlabeled text dataset (in this case, the training data includes among others Common Crawl and Wikipedia). Words or phrases are randomly removed from the text, and the model must learn to fill them in using only the surrounding words as context. It’s a simple training task that results in a powerful and generalizable model.\r\n",
