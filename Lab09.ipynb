Instead of explicitly assigning an index to each word and keeping a reference of these indices in a dictionary, one may hash words into vectors of fixed size. This is typically done with a very lightweight hashing function. The main advantage of this method is that it does away with maintaining an explicit word index, which saves memory and allows online encoding of the data (starting to generate token vectors right away, before having seen all of the available data). The one drawback of this method is that it is susceptible to \"hash collisions\": two different words may end up with the same hash, and subsequently any machine learning model looking at these hashes won't be able to tell the difference between these words. The likelihood of hash collisions decreases when the dimensionality of the hashing space is much larger than the total number of unique tokens being hashed.\n",

While the vectors obtained through one-hot encoding are binary, sparse (mostly made of zeros) and very high-dimensional (same dimensionality as the number of words in the vocabulary), \"word embeddings\" are low-dimensional floating point vectors (i.e. \"dense\" vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors). Unlike word vectors obtained via one-hot encoding, word embeddings are learned from data. It is common to see word embeddings that are 256-dimensional, 512-dimensional, or 1024-dimensional when dealing with very large vocabularies. On the other hand, one-hot encoding words generally leads to vectors that are 20,000-dimensional or higher (capturing a vocabulary of 20,000 token in this case). So, word embeddings pack more information into far fewer dimensions.\n"

It would be very difficult for a deep neural network to make sense of such a noisy, unstructured embedding space.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get a bit more abstract: the geometric relationships between word vectors should reflect the semantic relationships between these words. Word embeddings are meant to map human language into a geometric space. For instance, in a reasonable embedding space, we would expect synonyms to be embedded into similar word vectors, and in general we would expect the geometric distance (e.g. L2 distance) between any two word vectors to relate to the semantic distance of the associated words (words meaning very different things would be embedded to points far away from each other, while related words would be closer). Even beyond mere distance, we may want specific directions in the embedding space to be meaningful.\n",

Word embedding spaces typically feature thousands of such interpretable and potentially useful vectors.\n",

Possibly, but in any case, we have yet to compute anything of the sort. Also, there isn't such a thing as \"human language\", there are many different languages and they are not isomorphic, as a language is the reflection of a specific culture and a specific context. But more pragmatically, what makes a good word embedding space depends heavily on your task: the perfect word embedding space for an English-language movie review sentiment analysis model may look very different from the perfect embedding space for an English-language legal document classification model, because the importance of certain semantic relationships varies from task to task.\n",

The rationale behind using pre-trained word embeddings in natural language processing is very much the same as for using pre-trained convnets in image classification: we don't have enough data available to learn truly powerful features on our own, but we expect the features that we need to be fairly generic, i.e. common visual features or semantic features. In this case it makes sense to reuse features learned on a different problem.\n",

Its developers have made available pre-computed embeddings for millions of English tokens, obtained from Wikipedia data or from Common Crawl data.\n",
